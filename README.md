# Healthcare_Project_Theorax
## Objective: Reducing the mortality rates of ICU-Admitted patients by finding out the factors that contribute most significantly to predicting fatality among patients.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis(EDA) on patient data to identify patterns and trends.
- Worked with the data team to clean and transform data for analysis.
- Implemented Python, Statistics, and Scikit-Learn to create a model with 95% accuracy.
- Based on the model we found the factors that contribute most significantly in predicting fatality among patients to
create precautionary layers of diagnostics for early detection and preventive action.
